\noindent
Run  the  TeX  typesetter on file, usually creating file.dvi.
If the file argument has no extension, ".tex" will be appended to it.
Instead of a filename, a set of TeX commands can be given, the first of which must start with a backslash.
With a \&format argument TeX uses a different set of  precompiled  commands,
contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the -fmt format option instead.
